                <h3>Testimonial Statements:</h3>
                    <p>HarDi Detailing Services detailed and washed the inside and outside of our 2 vehicles and did an absolutely amazing job! We have a fluffy German Shepherd dog who goes for rides with us so there was some dog hair on the seats and floor and Harold removed it all. Our dog also likes to do nose art on the windows and Harold cleaned the slate for her to make new artwork. The job was done at the time we were promised it would be and nothing was damaged. Both vehicles look new again. We plan to bring our vehicles to them again and have told our friends about their services.</p>

                    <p>I made the appointment for detailing for my car.  Wow what service they picked my car up completed the detailing and returned my car I couldn't believe how fantastic it looked, it was so clean inside and out and for the first time since owning it I was very happy to get in and drive it, it even drove better.  I'll be back for sure. </p>

                    <p>Having an opportunity to have my vehicle detailed by Harold for the past few years has been a blessing. He sure is kind and caring so easy to work with. Love how great he pays close attention to detail and how my Jeep had a clean new car smell every time. He always has such an uplifting positive attitude so easy to pay his rates for his work. I really enjoy giving him a tip as well because when someone shows you real genuine kindness and professionalism work, it is an honor to pay with extra every time. I highly recommend Harold. Thank you kindly for making my jeep new a few times now. Looking forward to you meeting my new Truck.</p>
