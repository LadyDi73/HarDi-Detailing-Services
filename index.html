                <div class="russ"> It changed from an old used farm truck to a truck even my wife was proud to drive. <em><strong>Russ</strong></em></div>
                <div class="dean"><em>I took my pickup truck in for detailing, leaving it in their care for the work. It had only been cleaned by me once a year, so it had never been detailed professionally before. Just a few hours later, I received a call saying it was nearly finished. When I went to pick it up, I was blown away by how spotless it was. They had cleaned areas I never expected to see touched, and the interior looked fantastic. I was very impressed! I plan to have my truck detailed semi-annually from now on and will definitely spread the word about their excellent service. <strong>Dean</strong></em></div>
                <div class="colleen"> HarDi Detailing Services detailed and washed the inside and outside of our 2 vehicles and did an absolutely amazing job! We have a fluffy German Shepherd dog who goes for rides with us so there was some dog hair on the seats and floor and Harold removed it all. Our dog also likes to do nose art on the windows and Harold cleaned the slate for her to make new artwork. The job was done at the time we were promised it would be and nothing was damaged. Both vehicles look new again. We plan to bring our vehicles to them again and have told our friends about their services. <em><strong>Colleen</strong></em></div>
                <div class="susan"><em>I made the appointment for detailing for my car.  Wow what service they picked my car up completed the detailing and returned my car I couldn't believe how fantastic it looked, it was so clean inside and out and for the first time since owning it I was very happy to get in and drive it, it even drove better.  I'll be back for sure. <strong>Susan</strong></em></div>
                <div class="justin">Having an opportunity to have my vehicle detailed by Harold for the past few years has been a blessing. He sure is kind and caring so easy to work with. Love how great he pays close attention to detail and how my Jeep had a clean new car smell every time. He always has such an uplifting positive attitude so easy to pay his rates for his work. I really enjoy giving him a tip as well because when someone shows you real genuine kindness and professionalism work, it is an honor to pay with extra every time. I highly recommend Harold. Thank you kindly for making my jeep new a few times now. Looking forward to you meeting my new Truck. <em><strong>"Megwetch" Justin</strong></em></div>
